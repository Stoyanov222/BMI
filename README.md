# BMR Calculator App

## Overview

I’m currently developing a BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) Calculator application using Python and CustomTkinter. This tool aims to help users estimate their daily caloric needs based on their weight, height, age, and activity level.

## Features (Planned)

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Utilizing CustomTkinter to create a modern and intuitive GUI.
- **BMR Calculation:** Computes BMR and adjusts for various activity levels to estimate daily caloric needs.
- **Data Export:** Feature to export results to an Excel file for tracking and analysis.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures accurate data entry with built-in validation and the ability to reset fields.
- **Database Integration:** Saves and loads data from a SQLiteCloud database.
- **Theme Change**

## Current Status

The project is still in progress, and I’m actively working on adding and refining features. As I continue development, I plan to enhance the functionality and improve the user experience.

## Installation

To run the application, you need Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install customtkinter numpy pandas sqlitecloud
